                    <p>Toronto’s LGBQT community has felt a lack of effort of the Toronto Police Service and
                        inefficient investigations led to six community members disappearing and eventually been
                        found murdered by alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur. Interviews are conducted with Haran
                        Vijayanathan and Monica Forrester who represent LGBQT advocacy groups in the
                        Greater Toronto Area, give opinions on the McArthur investigation and provides insight
                        into the community’s relationship with Toronto Police.</p>

                      crime, especially of the most horrendous nature. There is no one tell-all answer, but several

                      why/how alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur committed these horrible crimes.</p>
