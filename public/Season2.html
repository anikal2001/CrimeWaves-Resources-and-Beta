                              <p>The Ecole Polytechnique, also known as the Montreal Massacre was a mass shooting that took place on 
                                December 6, 1989, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. About fourteen young women were murdered and 13 other people
                                were injured by the infamous Marc Lepine. Lepine was a man of few words but had a lot of hatred built up 
                                for those who he believed had done wrong. The Ecole Polytechnique tragedy will remain a reminder to not only 
                                the victims and their families but to everyone as an event that changed history on action and violence against 
                                women. With our condolences, we will now begin to show you what it was like being in Montreal, Canada a few days 
                                leading up to the shooting, during the shooting which took place, and the aftermath of the tragedy.</p>

                          <p>On December 6, 1989, 14 young females fell victim to Marc Lepine’s rampage at the Quebec Engineering school, 
                            École Polytechnique. Marc Lepine repeatedly claimed all feminists had ruined his life as he went on to kill every
                            woman who came in his sight. Though many females in the institute did not identify themselves as feminists at the 
                            time of the massacre, Lepine’s attack reformed the views of feminism in the minds of many women. Many of these women
                            went on to become public speakers, spreading awareness on the importance of mental health or raising their voices to 
                            enforce stricter gun regulations to prevent such a tragedy from recurring. Today each of these women are recognized as 
                            an influential part of our society as they continue to keep alive the legacies of their departed classmates.

                              This episode will delve into the purpose of the media is in events such as this. In addition, 
                              it adds a modern perspective by analyzing the effect of social media and how it can change the 
                              perspective of individuals from 1989 in comparison to those of 2018. Furthermore this episode 
                              also focuses on the key topics that media outlets choose to speak on and how these topics affect 
                              the audience as a whole. Overall, the media was and is indefinitely a determining factor of others 
                              opinions on the massacre because media regulates and forms the stories people hear daily. Power, that 
                              is what the media has.

                          <p>"Why?" was the question that rang through everyone's head when the École Polytechnique massacre was
                            broadcasted to the world. "Why did Marc Lepine commit such a horrendous crime?" In this episode, we will
